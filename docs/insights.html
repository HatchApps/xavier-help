accounts. Below the summary boxes is also a card for the full <em>Unreconciled Impact</em> - this card will display
the difference between the <em>Statement Balance</em> and the <em>Xero Balance</em> (you can click on the card for the detail).</p> <h4 id="net-assets"><a href="#net-assets" class="header-anchor">#</a> Net Assets</h4> <p>The Net Assets figure is a calculated balance of all transactions with the <strong>Account Class</strong> of <em>ASSET</em> minus all

metric on the <a href="/clients.html#client-list">Client List</a> and <a href="/clients.html#practice-dashboard">Practice Dashboard</a>. Xero

Expanding this card displays three unreconciled categories; <em>Outstanding Payments</em>,
<em>Outstanding Receipts</em> and <em>Unreconciled Statement Lines</em>.
Expanding one of these categories allows you to see transaction-level detail in a flexible grid view. From each record,
you can click straight into Xero to start the reconciliation process. The grid allows you to quickly order by the
oldest records (useful if you are approaching month end), and also see/filter/group the records that are in a &quot;locked&quot;
period.</p> <p><img src="/assets/img/cleanup-bank-rec-payments.338980c6.png" alt="Bank Reconciliation"></p> <h3 id="foreign-currency-bank-accounts"><a href="#foreign-currency-bank-accounts" class="header-anchor">#</a> Foreign Currency Bank Accounts</h3> <p>Xavier detects when a bank account is in a different currency to the base currency of the organisation, and displays
accordingly. There's a toggle that allows you to view the reconciliation totals for a bank account in either the native
currency of the bank account or the base currency of the organisation.</p> <p><img src="/assets/img/cleanup-bank-rec-multi-currency.543729e1.png" alt="Bank Reconciliation"></p> <div class="tip custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">TIP</p> <p>Xavier does not have access to Xero's exchange rates, so the base currency calculated balances for a foreign currency

to be a potential duplicate. Dismissed items do not contribute to the <a href="/clients.html#client-health-score">Health Score</a>.
Any dismissed duplicates can be viewed by selecting <em>dismissed</em> from the filter at the top
of the screen, where you can then review and <em>undo</em> any accidental dismissals.</p> <p>You can dismiss multiple duplicates at a time by selecting '<em>Select All</em>' above the list, or by using the circular checkbox
on the right of the card (on the right of the <em>Dismiss</em> button) on all duplicates you would like to dismiss, and then click
'<em>Dismiss (X) Suggestion(s)</em>'.</p> <h2 id="duplicate-transactions"><a href="#duplicate-transactions" class="header-anchor">#</a> Duplicate Transactions</h2> <p><img src="/assets/img/duplicate-transactions.4ab800eb.png" alt="Duplicate Transactions"></p> <p>Here Xavier looks across invoices and bank transactions and highlights records that it thinks could be unwanted duplicates.
This view allows you and your clients avoid embarrassing situations where you might inadvertently pay a supplier twice,
or charge a customer twice. You can filter the check between <em>Purchase</em> and <em>Sales</em> transactions, and sort by contact <em>Name</em>,
transaction <em>Value</em> or <em>Date</em>.</p> <p>Each detected duplicate is presented in a card for the combination of Contact and Value (in this case, it is good to ensure
your Duplicate Contacts are all cleaned up). Clicking on this card to expand it will show the transactions in a grid format
with further information on the type, source and description. You can then click the links in this grid to see the transaction
or invoice directly in Xero.</p> <p>The Alert level on the Overview refers directly to the number of duplicate transactions relative to the total number of
transactions in the reporting period.</p> <h4 id="sales-transactions"><a href="#sales-transactions" class="header-anchor">#</a> Sales Transactions</h4> <p>Duplicate sales transactions result in overstated revenue and unnecessary chasing of customers that have already paid.
This can happen due to human error accidentally raising invoices that have already been raised, or from integrations with
another system that can sometimes incorrectly pull in duplicates.</p> <h4 id="purchase-transactions"><a href="#purchase-transactions" class="header-anchor">#</a> Purchase Transactions</h4> <p>Duplicate purchase transactions can result in serious mistakes such as paying a supplier twice. Expenses might also be
overstated for the period. Additionally, paid transactions sitting in Aged Payables are messy and can reflect badly on
the standards of the accountant or bookkeeper. These can occur when there is a purchase invoice duplicate based on the
same criteria as a sales invoice, or when the invoice is an Aged Payable, but reconciled in the bank using 'create transaction',
creating both a bank transaction and an invoice against the same item.</p> <h3 id="dismissals-2"><a href="#dismissals-2" class="header-anchor">#</a> Dismissals</h3> <p>Dismissing duplicate transactions means that Xavier will no longer count that combination of invoices and transactions for that contact
to be a potential duplicate. Dismissed items do not contribute to the <a href="/clients.html#client-health-score">Health Score</a>.
Any dismissed duplicates can be viewed by selecting <em>dismissed</em> from the filter at the top

The majority of the time, these codes <em>should</em> be consistent for a given supplier or customer.</p> <p>It happens to be best of us though - sometimes these records are assigned the wrong codes, or coding evolves over time.

Xavier will find and evaluate contacts
that have been active (i.e. they have transactions) during this time period. For example, this could be your reporting
period of the previous month.</p> <p><strong>Check Transactions Since</strong>: Once Xavier finds the active contacts to evaluate, this date refers to how far back in
time Xavier should look into each Contact's transaction history to compare account and tax codes and surface any
inconsistencies. For example, if you know that you changed your accounts structure at the start of the year, it doesn't
make sense to evaluate transaction history before the change, so set this date to be the 1st of January (or whenever
you made the change).</p> <h3 id="narrowing-the-scope"><a href="#narrowing-the-scope" class="header-anchor">#</a> Narrowing The Scope</h3> <p>The Multi-Coded Contacts insight allows you to get really targeted with the data cleanup process, and quickly filter out
any suggestions that don't make sense for your situation.</p> <p><strong>Revenue | Expense | All</strong>: Restrict the suggestions list to only transactions relating to Revenue OR Expenses.</p> <p><strong>Account | Tax | All</strong>: Restrict the suggestions list to only transactions Xavier has identified with Account Code
anomalies, OR Tax Code anomalies.</p> <h3 id="understanding-the-colour-coding"><a href="#understanding-the-colour-coding" class="header-anchor">#</a> Understanding the Colour-Coding</h3> <p>Xavier adds colour to the transaction rows to provide a clear indication as to which transactions fall into the &quot;Active
During&quot; period and which ones are historical:</p> <p><img src="/assets/img/cleanup-multi-coded-colours.10afeeb0.png" alt="Understanding Multi-Coded Colour Coding"></p> <h4 id="dismissals-3"><a href="#dismissals-3" class="header-anchor">#</a> Dismissals</h4> <p>If there is good reason for the different coding, then you can dismiss the multi-coded alert and it will not show again.
Any dismissed alerts can be viewed by selecting <em>dismissed</em> from the filter at the top of the screen, where you can then review and <em>undo</em> any accidental dismissals. Dismissed items do not contribute to the <a href="/clients.html#client-health-score">Health Score</a>.</p> <p>This dismissal applies to a few levels below the contact, taking into account both <em>direction</em> (Payable/Receivable) and
whether they are <em>Tax Code</em> or <em>Account Code</em> differences.</p> <p>For example, you can dismiss an alert for a contact with differences in receivable account codes, and we won't raise any
more alerts for additional receivable account codes placed against that contact, but you will still get an alert for that
client if we detect multiple <em>payable</em> account code differences, or multiple receivable <em>tax codes</em>.</p> <h2 id="contact-defaults"><a href="#contact-defaults" class="header-anchor">#</a> Contact Defaults</h2> <p>Contacts in Xero can be setup with &quot;default&quot; account codes and tax types for sales and purchases. If set, Xero will use these to
pre-populate the account code or tax type fields during bank statement reconciliation. For contacts that your client has
a recurring relationship with (e.g. a supplier that bills monthly), setting these defaults in Xero can dramatically
speed up the reconciliation process:</p> <p><img src="/assets/img/cleanup-contact-defaults-xero-settings.2de0bc7e.png" alt="Setting Contact Defaults in Xero"></p> <p>Figuring out which contacts are eligible for setting up these defaults can be time consuming. This Xavier system
analyses each contact's transaction history and searches for contacts where either sales or purchase invoices have been
consistently assigned the same account code or tax type, and presents these up to you in a handy list:</p> <p><img src="/assets/img/cleanup-contact-defaults.3d1803f6.png" alt="Contact Defaults"></p> <p>You can review the transaction history of these contacts and decide whether or not to apply Xavier's suggestion.</p> <p>Clicking <em>Set as default</em> does what is says on the tin - Xavier will prompt you to confirm before setting the suggested

The idea is to help you identify old account codes that could be cleaned up, either through archiving or deleting, for
better reporting.</p> <p>You can filter and sort to look at accounts with transactional history (activity) and also by Account Class. Xavier
won't show you Xero System Accounts and certain other Accounts as they cannot be archived.</p> <p>For each account suggested by Xavier, you can either archive it, or dismiss it. Archiving the suggestion makes the
appropriate change in Xero. Dismissing the suggestion will hide it from the &quot;Suggested&quot; list, but you can always undo
this from the &quot;Dismissed&quot; list if you want it back.</p> <p>You can also follow the link to Xero's Chart of Accounts to restore an archived account or delete one. Read more on

the board or to the tax authorities? All the accountants we know have run into this at some point. Everyone makes
mistakes, and it can be quite easy for someone with Advisor privileges in Xero to create a record with the wrong journal
date.</p> <p>The tricky thing is tracking down these changes so they can be amended. Xavier allows you to identify exactly what was
changed and when within seconds. Simply input the historical reporting period that you want to check, and the close date
from which you expect no more transactions to have been logged for that period, and click <em>Run Report</em>.</p> <p>Xavier queries the underlying journal transactions for the client, and looks for transactions that have a journal date
within the historical period, but a created date of <strong>after</strong> the reporting close date.</p> <p>You'll be able to jump straight to the offending transaction(s) in Xero from the results. And, in case you need to show
someone else where it all went wrong, you can always export the results to PDF.</p> <h3 id="companies-house-periods-uk-only"><a href="#companies-house-periods-uk-only" class="header-anchor">#</a> Companies House Periods (UK Only)</h3> <p>For UK companies, using Companies House data we can pull back your last filing period and the date the accounts were filed in the secondary navigation.
Use the 'Use these dates' option to auto-populate the Historical Changes insight with your last filing dates.</p> <p>A metric will be shown in the Practice Dashboard to highlight where there has been any changes to filed data.</p> <div class="tip custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">TIP</p> <p>Xavier uses the Companies House number it detects in Xero to make this connection - if we can't display any data, check
the Companies House number in Xero is correct and update if necessary.</p></div> <h3 id="historical-changes-checks"><a href="#historical-changes-checks" class="header-anchor">#</a> Historical Changes Checks</h3> <p>The Historical Changes check is also available in <a href="/focus.html">Focus</a>; for UK companies, this will be automatically populated as the
last filing period, but it can also be adjusted during the Flow.</p> <h2 id="regular-suppliers"><a href="#regular-suppliers" class="header-anchor">#</a> Regular Suppliers</h2> <p>Regular Suppliers has now become <em>Cost Analysis</em>! See below...</p> <h2 id="cost-analysis"><a href="#cost-analysis" class="header-anchor">#</a> Cost Analysis</h2> <p><img src="/assets/img/insight-cost-analysis.eb171f7a.png" alt="Cost Analysis"></p> <p>The Cost Analysis insight is designed to analyse your client's expenses across their supplier base and their expense accounts
over time and automatically detect issues. Our AI will look for months where the total amount paid is unusual compared to other months.</p> <p>Clicking a supplier or account will show a chart of amounts over time and highlight the periods where we have detected there
may be an issue. Clicking on a bar in the chart will explain the issue that we have found and show a summary of payments to the
supplier or account in the chosen period. You may then choose to dismiss the alert or go through to Xero to investigate.</p> <h3 id="regularity"><a href="#regularity" class="header-anchor">#</a> Regularity</h3> <p>On each Supplier or Account Code card is an indicator on the right for Xavier's best guess on the regularity of those payments to that supplier or account code, e.g. <em>weekly</em> or <em>monthly</em>.</p> <h3 id="dismissals-6"><a href="#dismissals-6" class="header-anchor">#</a> Dismissals</h3> <p>Each anomalous period can be 'dismissed' if you have reviewed the period and do not want Xavier to raise it again.
The card for that supplier or account will not be removed from the view until all anomalous periods in the chart have been dismissed.
Dismissed items do not contribute to the <a href="/clients.html#client-health-score">Health Score</a>.
Any dismissed periods can be viewed by selecting <em>dismissed</em> from the filter at the top
of the screen, where you can then review and <em>undo</em> any accidental dismissals.</p> <h3 id="filters"><a href="#filters" class="header-anchor">#</a> Filters</h3> <ul><li><em>Display Mode</em> - Use the Display Mode to toggle between reviewing cost by <em>Supplier</em> and cost by <em>Account Code</em>. Both views work in exactly the same way, except for the categorisation of costs.</li> <li><em>Active During</em> - Set this date parameter to view only suppliers or account codes active in a certain period.</li> <li><em>Anomalies | Dismissed | All Suppliers/Accounts</em> - Use this filter to view either all anomalies detected, all dismissed
anomalies, or simply all account codes or suppliers, regardless of any anomalies or dismissals, for a full review.</li></ul> <h2 id="sales-analysis"><a href="#sales-analysis" class="header-anchor">#</a> Sales Analysis</h2> <p><img src="/assets/img/sales-analysis-screenshot-min.e28bc321.png" alt="Sales Analysis Screenshot"></p> <p>This feature allows you to review your client's revenue for a given period, breaking it down into who their key customers are and how
much revenue each of these customers generate.</p> <h3 id="accumulated-revenue"><a href="#accumulated-revenue" class="header-anchor">#</a> Accumulated Revenue</h3> <p>This chart demonstrates how much of your client's revenue comes from a smaller proportion of customers. The chart area
is cumulative; the steeper the curve is at the beginning, the more revenue is generated by that segment. The curve will
typically then level off, as later segments contribute less to the revenue total.</p> <p>Revenue-generating contacts are listed in the grid below the chart, grouped by segment, with an indication of how reliant the client
is on that contact. By identifying these key revenue generating customers, you can give clients informed advice as to
where they should be focusing their time.</p> <p>This grid lists a few key stats:</p> <ul><li><em>Customer</em> is the contact name, and clicking on it will link to the contact in Xero</li> <li><em>Revenue</em> is the amount of revenue generated by that customer during the period</li> <li><em>Transactions</em> is the number of transactions generated by that customer during the period</li> <li><em>Reliance</em> is the percentage of total revenue which comes from that customer in the period</li> <li><em>Debtor Days</em> is a calculation of the time the customer typically takes to pay</li></ul> <h3 id="average-monthly-revenue"><a href="#average-monthly-revenue" class="header-anchor">#</a> Average Monthly Revenue</h3> <p>Xavier then provides two key stats for the client; average monthly revenue for the period, and the average monthly revenue
per customer for the period.</p></div> <div class="page-edit"><!----> <div class="last-updated"><span class="prefix">Last Updated: </span> <span class="time">8/17/2020, 9:03:07 PM</span></div></div> <div class="page-nav"><p class="inner"><span class="prev">
