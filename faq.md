# FAQ

## Billing

### What is a client?

For Xavier, a client is a Xero organisation that Xavier will sync with – typically this is your business or your client’s
Xero account. Learn about our [Xero Integration](/xero-integration.md).

### What counts as a user?

Users are anybody that you invite into your Xavier [team](/team-management.md). All plans include unlimited users.

### Do I have to pay for each user?

No. The subscription price is inclusive of an unlimited number of users.

### How can I pay for Xavier?

We accept secure payments via MasterCard, Visa and AMEX. Credit card details can be entered within Xavier user settings,
either during or after your free trial.

### Is there a minimum term?

There are no minimum terms for your Xavier service. If you decide to cancel, you will have access to Xavier until the
end of your monthly billing cycle, which will not renew.

### When will I be billed?

Xavier bills in advance; you will receive an invoice by email for the number of clients active in the previous monthly billing cycle, which begins when you have entered your payment details, and any free trials have ended.

### What happens when I add or remove clients?

If you add or remove a client during the monthly billing cycle, you will be billed accordingly for that client at the start of the next monthly billing cycle.

### What's your Custom Pricing?

If you have more than 250 clients, please [get in touch](/contact-us.md) and we can arrange a custom plan for you that
will meet your needs.

### Can I change plans at any time?

If you're lucky enough to grow to need more than 50 clients whilst using Xavier, please inform us by
[email](/contact-us.md) and we'll get you sorted with a personalised plan right away.

## Regional Compatibility

### Does Xavier work outside the UK?

Xavier does accept multiple currencies - it detects the currency used in Xero, and will display that currency for that client accross the site.

Xavier currently only uses UK tax calculations; for clients outside the UK we slightly alter the Xavier experience in the following ways to prevent confusion:

* Hide Corporation Tax and VAT Tracking Insights from the navigation
* Hide Corporation Tax and VAT Tracking Insight statistics from the Client Overview dashboard
* Rename VAT Return Checks to Tax Return Checks

### Will Xavier include tax calculations for clients outside the UK in the future?

We've definitely got this on our roadmap! There's no real timescale for this though. For now, we're focussing on making sure that we are building a great product and
that means working with local accountants. We still love hearing from our international users, so if you would like to see Xavier
bring tax insights to your region then please let us know. This helps us to prioritise which regions to start with.

> We feel that Xavier is a really useful toolkit for any Xero client data, not just UK clients, so we would encourage you to
> try Xavier for your team, wherever you're based. For international accountancies who would like a Xavier paid subscription, we offer
> a discount code which will apply until we roll out full functionality in your area.

## Working with Xero

### How do I connect Xavier to my Xero account?

A walkthrough of connecting Xavier to Xero can be found in our [Getting Started](/getting-started.md#adding-your-first-client) guide.

### What Xero data does Xavier use, and how?

With your approval, we create a _Client_ in Xavier out of the data we get from Xero. We keep Xavier up to date with any
changes in Xero with an automated syncing process. Our [Xero Integration](/xero-integration.md#how-do-we-interact-with-xero)
guide has more info on the data we use, and the [syncing](/xero-integration.md#syncing) process.

### Can I stop Xavier from syncing with Xero?

Yes, you can [disconnect](/xero-integration.md#managing-the-xero-connection) Xavier from Xero, which retains a snapshot
of the data in Xavier without further updates. You can also [delete](/faq.md#how-can-i-remove-a-client-from-xavier) a
client from Xavier completely.

## Data Management

### Is my data secure?

Short answer: yes.

Longer answer: security is baked into the core of what we do, from the technologies we use to the best practices we
follow around coding and infrastructure. Each client's data is housed in its own separate database, key information
and backups are encrypted at rest and data in transit always journeys via SSL (https).

Your data is yours - we do not share your data with anyone.

### Can I invite my clients to Xavier?

We actually don’t recommend you give clients access to Xavier; while there are
[visibility settings](http://help.xavier-analytics.com/clients.html#client-visibility) in Xavier that you can use to
prevent members of your team seeing client data, your team members still have visibility of the list of other team members
in various places, so if you add clients as team members those names will be visible.

Instead, we would recommend either you set up a separate Xavier account for that client, or use the exports available
within the Xavier tools. Many of our tools are exportable to either Excel or pdf, and you can export any grids in Xavier
to Excel by right-clicking in any cell (exporting of Flows is not yet possible but will be available soon).

### How can I remove a client from Xavier?

Deleting a client from Xavier removes all corresponding data from the Xavier system. This is not
reversable - to bring a client back you'll need to go through the process of
[adding a new client](/getting-started.md#adding-your-first-client).

There are two places you can delete a client from Xavier - the _Client Overview_:

![Delete From Overview](./images/delete-from-overview.png)

or from the options menu of a client on the _Client List_ page:

![Delete From Client List](./images/delete-from-client-list.png)

You'll be prompted to confirm before proceeding.

Your data in Xero will not be affected by the removal of a client in Xavier.

### How do I leave Xavier?

Had enough of Xavier and want to delete your account? 

If you are looking to pause your subscription for a period, you can do so under _Manage Team_ from the sidebar in the 
Client List. Under _Manage Team_, select _Subscription_, and select the _Cancel Subscription_ button.

If you are looking to delete your team permanently, you will need to create a new Team if you want to return to Xavier at 
a later date. Please note, only a Team Owner can delete a team. To delete your team, click on your user avatar in 
the top right of the screen and select _your settings_ from the dropdown list. From the links on the left of the page, 
select _Teams_ to see the list of Xavier teams you currently belong to (this will usually be just 1). Click the _X_ button 
to the right of the team name to delete the team. Please note, this action cannot be undone.
