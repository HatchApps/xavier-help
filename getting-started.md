# Getting Started

Prefer one-on-one? Speak to a member of our team for a demo [here](https://dext.com/wizard/book-a-demo/precision).

We've also got a series of video tutorials on the _Learn_ section of our site: [https://xavier-analytics.com/learn/](https://xavier-analytics.com/learn/)

## Registration

When you sign up to Dext Precision you're asked to provide a team name. This is because we've designed Precision from the ground up
to work well in a team environment - clients and shared reports can all be accessed by team members, so no wheels need
reinventing.

Think your company may already have a Precision team? Drop your organiser a line and ask for an invite. In case they don't
know how to do this, you can share this help link with them:

## Adding Your First Client

It all kicks off in Precision when you add your first client. A Client in Precision is linked to an Organisation in Xero, or a Company in QuickBooks Online (QBO).
After you register you'll be taken to the home page. This is where your team's clients will live once they've been imported from your accounting software.
Clicking Import your first client will give you an option to select which accounting software you would like to import your first client from; either Xero or QBO.  

If you select Xero, the app will take you to Xero, and you will be asked to login if you haven't already. You'll then be asked to select the Xero organisation you want to connect to Dext Precision, and allow access to the data for import.
If you select QBO, the app will take you to QBO, and you will be asked to login if you haven't already. If you have more than one Company in QBO, you’ll then be asked to select the Company you want to connect to Dext Precision, and allow access to the data for import. 

After allowing Precision access, you'll be redirected back to the app, where the initial sync process will begin. This can take between 1 and 45 minutes depending on the size of the client.
Once the initial sync is finished, your client is ready for analysis - go forth!

Once you've got a client added, click on through to the [Client Overview](/clients.md#client-overview).

## Bulk Adding Clients [Xero Only]

::: warning Please note:
Only Whole Team and Xero Users Only visibility settings are available with Bulk Client Import. For Specific Users Only, import first, then use the new Bulk Client Visibility Settings feature. For more information, see [Client Visibility](/clients.html#client-visibility).
:::

Using Xero's bulk client functionality, Dext Precision’s Bulk Client Import feature allows you to import all of your Xero clients at once. Configure the visibility and account managers in one shot to get up and running straight away.

When you select to add a Xero client, you'll be taken to Xero and asked to log in as usual. To bulk import, instead of selecting only one client, you can select some or all of your Xero clients, by ticking the box next to each client that you want to import. You will then be automatically returned to Precision as usual.

If the number of clients selected exceeds your team bundle limit (or 10 clients, if you are in a Free Trial), you will be able to remove the clients that you don’t want to import.

Once the clients have been selected, there will be a screen to choose the visibility setting and account managers for each of these clients. You can also choose to apply the first setting to all clients for import.

To make sure the bulk import runs smoothly, the clients will be imported in batches of 5, which you will see importing in the client list.
