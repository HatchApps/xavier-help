# The Sandbox & Practice Reports
The Sandbox is your data playground, a place where your KPI hopes and dreams can come to life. The Sandbox is available 
within any client that belongs to your team, and also at the Team level containing all data across all your clients. 

The Sandbox grid format is used throughout Xavier, usually wherever you see a table, so many of the tricks that apply to 
these large grid reports such as sorting and exporting also apply to the grids within cards.

## The Client Sandbox

Each Client in Xavier has a Snadbox view in the sidebar. A core piece of Xavier functionality since it's launch, we start 
with Xero's Journal Line Items as a base, and supplement each record with additional data based on the type of
journal it is - be it an Invoice, and Bank Transaction, a Credit Note and so on. We also bring in Contact and Account
information so you've got all the key information you need in one place.

## Practice Analysis

At the team level, Xavier has 4 different practice-level sandboxes that contain data across all your clients. They are:

### Practice Dashboard
A comprehensive home of your Xavier clients, this is the first place to come to get a handle on your practice. Each row is a client in Xavier, and here we store many of the Xavier metrics 

Please note, all Practice Dashboard metrics come from the last complete month, to ensure that every metric is comparable for each client.  

Here's a short introduction to the Practice Dashboard functionality from Simon Williams; note that since this was recorded 
the dashboard is still evolving, and we add more metrics to it all the time!

### Activity Stats
The Acivity Stats view is your source for Xavier's performance metrics from the [Acitvity Stats](http://localhost:8081/insights.html#activity-stats) 
Insight, month-by-month for the last year. This includes _MoM_ and _YoY_ changes, so you can check which of your clients 
are under- or over- performing. 

Note that the Activity Stats dashboard, like the Practice Dashboard, defaults to the data from the last complete month and works backwards from there.

### HMRC Dashboard
For UK clients using our [HMRC integration](/integrations.html#hmrc-uk-only) this dashboard is your location for all things 
MTD in your practice. Each row is a VAT period detected by Xavier for each client, including the filing period, due dates, 
status, amount and outstanding values.

### Focus Dashboard
This dashboard is an alternative to the [Flow List](/focus.html#the-flow-list) in [Focus](https://help.xavier-analytics.com/focus.html#focus), 
showing _all_ Flows at all stages of completion. This includes the all Flow details including the assigned team member, 
reviewers, reporting period, number of checks completed and total number of checks.


## Customising the Grid
The sandbox grid is a drag and drop report-builder, with spreadsheet-like functionality, right in your browser. And if you're
a fan of Excel's pivot tables, you'll find that too. You can choose the columns you want to see, group-by, sort, collapse
and expand until you get it just how you want. In the image below the sandbox has been customised to group by Contact,
sort by Gross Amount and hide some columns.

Interested in the tech? Behind the scenes we've integrated [ag-Grid's amazing data tables framework](https://www.ag-grid.com/),
which provides the enterprise-grade pivot table functionality.

## Custom Reports
Grown a liking to your sandbox setup? You can save sandbox configurations as custom reports by clicking *Save*.

![Save Custom Report](./images/save-custom-report.png)

You'll need to give your report a name. You can then decide whether to keep this report configuration private, or
share it with the rest of your team.

Custom reports are automatically added to your sidebar in the *Reports* section. The beautiful thing is that they are
available for any client that belongs to you or your team, not just the client you created it on.

You can make and save changes to a Custom Report configuration. When you do so you'll be asked whether you want to save
over the existing report or create a new one.

The Reports section also contains a number of Xavier default reporting configurations developed by the Xavier team, so 
be sure to check them out:

- Debtor Days and Cash Report (Practice Dashboard)
- Cost Review by Supplier (Client Sandbox)
- Cost Review by Report Code (Client Sandbox)
- Expenses by Month and Contact (Client Sandbox)
- Invoiced Totals by Contact (Client Sandbox)

Each custom report at the team level will have a coloured icon indicator next to it, to let you know where the data comes from:
- _Blue speedometer_: Practice Dashboard
- _Pink line chart_: Activity Stats
- _Yellow crown_: HMRC Dashboard

## Exporting Reports
From either the Sandbox or a Custom Report, or within any grid in a Check, you can export to a spreadsheet file. You can 
do this from the *Export* button in the banner at the top of the report (to produce a .xlsx file), or export to a csv 
file by right-clicking anywhere inside the grid and choosing *Export -> CSV Export*.
